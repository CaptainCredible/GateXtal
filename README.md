A monophonic FM synth using Mozzi library. By Daniel Lacey a.k.a. Captain Credible

This is a small FM synthesizer based on the Mozzi library for Arduino. 
with 4 knobs with 4-6 functions each (selected via "page" and "shift" buttons)
As of March 2018 i am busy transitioning the code to the STM32F103C8t6 microcontroller for more speed and pins.
